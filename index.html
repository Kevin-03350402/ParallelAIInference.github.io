    <h1>Optimized Mixture of Experts LLM (MoE) Inference</h1>
    
    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>We plan to implement an optimized attention layer to speed up mixture of experts LLM (MoE) inference on the NVIDIA GPUs in the lab. We'll explore architectural optimizations, such as leveraging shared memory for reduced access times and employing asynchronous operations to enhance GPU utilization. This design is expected to significantly improve inference efficiency, offering a pathway to more responsive LLM systems.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The focus of our project is on accelerating the inference phase of Large Language Models (LLMs) employing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, specifically by optimizing the attention layer on NVIDIA GPUs...</p>
        <p>Parallelism can significantly benefit this aspect of MoE LLMs for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Matrix Multiplications: The attention mechanism's core operations involve matrix multiplications that are inherently parallelizable...</li>
            <li>Data Routing: The process of routing input data to various experts can also be parallelized...</li>
            <li>Expert Processing: Since each 'expert' can operate independently, their computations can be performed in parallel...</li>
        </ul>
